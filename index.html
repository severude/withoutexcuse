      <h1>Without Excuse</h1>
      <p><em>For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.</em>  <b>Romans 1:20</b></p>
      <p>The verse above states rather boldly that we have no excuse regarding knowledge of the existence of God, his divine nature, and his eternal power, since it is clearly perceived by observing the world around us.  Is this really true?  Does this really make sense with our current knowledge of the earth?  Let's pick up a science book and examine what it has to say.</p>
      <p>Science is the study of testable, observable phenomena.  It seeks to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation, hypothesis, and experimental validation.  The essence of the <b>scientific method</b> is to speculate on the cause of an observed effect and then seek to recreate and test the cause experimentally.  Science has been the best system devised by man to give us information about nature.  However, the conclusions of science are not final and are repeatedly revised and even reversed as more information becomes available.</p>
      <p>The commitment of science is <b>materialism</b>, a material explanation of the phenomenal world.  It claims that life originated spontaneously from chemical matter, that all the different life forms came into being through the processes of mutation and natural selection over millions of years.  New species, new designs, new organs such as the eye, the wing, the ear arise by chance through the process of <b>evolution</b>.  The process is unguided, mindless, and unpredictable in its outcome and a Divine Foot in not allowed in the door.</p>
      <p>There are no obvious testable, observable phenomena on the <b>origin of life</b>.  The simplest form of life requires millions of parts at the atomic level, higher life forms require trillions.  Oversimplified, life depends on a complex arrangement of three classes of molecules: <b>DNA</b>, which stores the cell's master plans; <b>RNA</b>, which transports a copy of the needed information contained in the DNA to the protein assembly station; and <b>proteins</b>, which make up everything from ribosomes to enzymes.  Chaperons and many other assembly tools are needed to ensure that the protein is properly assembled.  All of these parts are necessary and must exist as a properly assembled and integrated unit.  These parts could not evolve separately and could not even exist independently for very long, because they would break down in the environment without protection.  Therefore, only an instantaneous creation of all the necessary parts as a functioning unit can produce life.</p>
      <p>There is enough <b>information</b> capacity in a single human cell to store <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>, all 30 volumes of it, three or four times over.  If the DNA of one human cell were unraveled and held in a straight line, it would literally be almost one meter long and yet be so thin it would be invisible to all but the most powerful microscopes.  The process of converting DNA information into protein requires at least 75 different protein molecules.  All the detailed chemical and structural complexity associated with the metabolism, repair, specialized function, and reproduction of each living cell is a realization of the <b>coded algorithms</b> stored in its DNA.  Every cell is more complex than a super-computer and can be compared to a thriving metropolis of super-computers all functioning together.</p>
      <p>The enormous amount of genetic information that is translated into the complexity that is evident everywhere in the living world is far beyond that which is found in both the non-living and human-manufactured world.  Consider the <b>substantially different wing types</b> of flying creatures: birds, insects, and bats.  There are four fundamental requirements for controlled heavier-than-air flight: (1) a correct wing shape to give a lower air pressure on the upper surface, (2) a large enough area to support the weight, (3) some means of propulsion or gliding, and (4) extra surfaces, or a means of altering the main surfaces, in order to change direction and speed.</p>
      <ul><li><b>Birds</b> have wings that are made of feathers.  The feather is a marvel of lightweight, flexible, aerodynamic engineering, with hooks and ridges which act like Velcro, but the ridges allow for a sliding joint to keep the surface flexible and intact.  Lift and drag can be balanced with instant movements, which in aircraft still require comparatively cumbersome changes in flaps and ailerons.  Birds can fly only because of exceedingly light hollow bone structures.  Extreme maneuverability is demonstrated by hummingbirds with the ability to swivel the wing through a much greater angle than other birds.</li><li><b>Insects</b> such as flies, moths and butterflies have perfect wing structures of exceedingly fragile wings made of scales, membranes or sometimes hairs or bristles.  The damselfly has the sophisticated aerodynamics of four wings operating independently which inspired early versions of modern helicopter design.  Monarch butterflies and honeybees are able to orient themselves by sensing the earth's magnetic fields.</li><li><b>Bats</b> have wings of skin spread out over a skeleton.  They also have a radar system of echo-sounding with pinpoint accuracy for finding insect-food during flight with unbelievable precision.</li></ul>
      <p><b>Biodiversity</b> refers to plants, animals, and microbes, from bacteria to fungi, that collectively make up living systems or <b>ecosystems</b>.  This includes the collective ecological services provided by those different species and populations working together for each other, keeping our planet healthy and suitable for life.  Biodiversity services purify water, pollinate flowers, fertilize soil, detoxify toxins, and maintain relatively constant atmospheric levels of carbon-dioxide and oxygen through photosynthesis and respiration.  These ecological relationships are so necessary that involved organisms cannot survive without them.  This <b>symbiosis</b> (mutual dependence of one species on another) suggests that these organisms and services must have been simultaneously present right from the beginning.</p>
      <p>The question then arises, how can such complexity possibly evolve out of random processes?  For example, assume that a frog is sterilized and put into a sterilized blender.  Even with the best possible mixture of precursors of life, life will not be produced, regardless of how many times the experiment is repeated.  Thermodynamics clearly states that the mixture will decompose into simpler, lower energy, less information-containing molecules.  Expecting life to be produced from this mixture is the equivalent of believing that a tornado striking a junkyard would reassemble the trash and leave behind a completed, assembled, and fully functioning Boeing 747.  And yet, when archaeologists examine a simple ordered structure such as a clay pot, it is obvious to them that it could not have come about by chance.</p>
      <p>And where does this genetic information come from?  DNA molecules can be strung out in line, copied, and still not contain any information, they will just be a collection of molecules.  Meaning cannot spontaneously arise, since meaning presupposes intelligence and understanding.  Seldom do we reflect on the fact that <b>language structures</b> are a clear manifestation of a non-material reality, a reality distinct from matter and energy.  We use language to communicate with each other by speaking, by writing, by using gestures, by using the internet or cellphones, and regardless of the method, the same message is conveyed and understood.  But how does matter bestow meaning to symbolic information?  Thermodynamics and information theory tell us that such structures do not and cannot arise in a spontaneous fashion.</p>
      <p>There are fundamental laws in the universe to which there are no known exceptions.  The laws of thermodynamics rest on direct observations of matter in the aggregate and require only relatively sure and simple observations for their truth to be evident.  The <b>first law of thermodynamics</b> implies that the universe (matter and energy) is a constant, that no matter or energy is currently being added to the universe.  This <b>energy conservation</b> principle implies that the universe did not start up by itself.  The <b>second law of thermodynamics</b> states that in any closed system, the amount of disorder always increases with time.  Things progress naturally from order to disorder, from an available energy state to one where energy becomes more unavailable (entropy).  This <b>energy decay</b> principle implies that this universe cannot last forever.  The second law rather humorously equates with Murphy's Law: "<em>Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.</em>"</p>
      <p>Despite the laws of thermodynamics, mutations and natural selection are offered as possible evolutionary mechanisms.  <b>Mutations</b> arise from errors occurring when DNA is copied to the offspring, as nucleic acid base letters in the code are changed, lost, or added.  Mutations are almost always detrimental and are more representative of a mechanism of degeneration than for advancement.  For example, if a typist hits the wrong key, the end result is a loss of needed information.  Random changes to a computer program will result in a loss of functional complexity, if not crashing the system.  It has never been observed where mutations add information to organisms.  <b>Natural selection</b> also eliminates genetic information.  It is the equivalent to the selection of all the yellow jellybeans from a bag of jellybeans.  Nothing new has appeared in the genes, there is no new information, and the end result is a reworking of what is already present.  For example, plant breeders will seek to use wild types in their breeding because our highly selected varieties are lacking genetic information present in their wild counterparts.  Natural selection is easily observable, but it cannot of itself create new information, since there is no upward development in the genetic complexity of the organism.  Mutations and natural selection do occur in our world, but they do not create new basic kinds of organisms.</p>
      <p>The <b>fossil record</b> offers clues to help determine what life on earth was previously like.  In order for a fossil to form, the recently dead (or living) organism must be rapidly buried in sediment that can harden and exclude oxygen.  For example, vertical fossilized trees (without roots) and violently buried and mangled bodies found fossilized in many rocks demonstrate that fossilization and formation of deep strata must occur rapidly.  The present-day erosion conditions applied uniformly in the past could not account for the unusual formations of the Grand Canyon, mesas, badlands, and other canyons.  Evidence for such intense global catastrophism is apparent throughout the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and much of the Cenozoic portions of the geological record.  The scale of the water catastrophe by such formations boggles the mind.</p>
      <p>Modern-day catastrophes have been observed to cause massive local sedimentary deposits and other geological features.  The catastrophic processes observed during and following the 1980 eruption of <b>Mount St. Helens</b> produced in a very brief period of time the Toutle River canyon, which is effectively a scale model of the Grand Canyon.  This demonstrates that rapid processes can produce effects commonly believed to require long periods of time.  Ironically, the radiometric dating of Mount St. Helen's lava estimated a very old age of 1.5 to 3 million years.</p>
      <p>Most of the continental areas are covered with vast sheets of water-laid sentiments.  No geologist denies that oceans once covered the land, since rocks containing marine fossils may be found today at elevations from one to five miles above sea level.  The fossil record documents a brief and intense global destruction of life and not a long evolutionary history.  The fossil record in detail shows that (1) life forms show little or no change during their history, (2) most fossil types are virtually identical to their living descendants, (3) fossil types appear in the fossil record without ancestral lineages, and (4) fossil organisms either became extinct or have survived into the present.  Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and <b>paleontology</b> does not provide them.  If indeed these rocks and fossils are the result of a global flood, then there is no evidence for evolution.</p>
      <p>In summary, it has never been observed that life is able to spontaneously originate from non-life via chemical evolution.  It has never been observed where one kind of life form can evolve into another kind of life form and the <b>second law of thermodynamics</b> opposes evolution totally.  The fossil layers do not contain transitional fossils that would demonstrate the occurrence of evolution, but instead show strong evidence for a steady loss of species.</p>
      <p>It is amazing to consider how incomplete evolutionists have been in applying scientific rigor to the methods they have used to retrospectively analyze data that deals with "origins".  Contradictory evidence is either suppressed or ignored because of preconceived assumptions and evolution is clung to against all reason with incredible, fanatical, and irrational religious fervor.  The rule of history is not one of continual creation, but one of extinction, as specific creatures are eliminated from the planet forever.  If evolution were a scientific hypothesis based on a rigorous study of the evidence, it would have been abandoned long ago.  Let's put away our science book and briefly examine a Bible.</p>
      <p>The Bible repeatedly claims over and over again that it was God who created the heavens and the earth.  In fact, God seems to be quite <a href="https://severude.github.io/creation">adamant</a> about this.  The fall of Satan and of man brought about "the curse", which is the cause for the earth and the heavens to "<em>wear out like a garment</em>" (Psalm 102:26) and "<em>the whole creation groans and suffers</em>" (Romans 8:22) (second law).  The Great Flood described in the Bible provides the explanation for the fossil layers.  Ultimately, the Bible offers a plan of <a href="https://severude.github.io/heaven">salvation</a> for man to be reconciled from the fall to God through repentance and faith.  And this is why, as the opening verse states above, that man is... <em>without excuse</em>.</p>
      <p><em>Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.</em> <b>Job 38:4</b></p>
